## Projects

### 1. Mortality Prediction in Patients with AKI
- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model for in-hospital mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for patients diagnosed with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI).  
  This project leverages retrospective clinical data to identify critical factors influencing patient outcomes.  
- **Data Source:** MIMIC-III database, comprising comprehensive clinical trajectories of ICU patients.  
  - **Target Variable:** In-hospital mortality (IHM), a binary indicator (1 = death in ICU).

### 2. Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection
- **Objective:** Construct a robust predictive model capable of identifying potential fraudulent claims within vehicle insurance.  
  This initiative aims to mitigate financial losses associated with fraud schemes such as staged accidents, phantom passengers, and exaggerated injury claims.  
- **Problem Statement:** Vehicle insurance fraud involves deliberate acts to file false or inflated claims. This project specifically targets the detection of such illicit activities through data-driven predictive analytics.
