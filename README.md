Applied Machine Learning

This repository showcases a collection of applied machine learning projects designed to address diverse real-world challenges. Each project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques, from traditional statistical models to advanced deep learning architectures, for predictive analytics and decision-making based on data.

Projects

Mortality Prediction in Patients with AKI

Objective: To develop a predictive model for in-hospital mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for patients diagnosed with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). This project leverages retrospective clinical data to identify critical factors influencing patient outcomes.

Data Source: MIMIC-III database, comprising comprehensive clinical trajectories of ICU patients. The target variable, in-hospital mortality (IHM), is a binary indicator (1 = death in ICU).

Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection

Objective: To construct a robust predictive model capable of identifying potential fraudulent claims within vehicle insurance. This initiative aims to mitigate financial losses associated with various fraud schemes, including staged accidents, phantom passengers, and exaggerated injury claims.

Problem Statement: Vehicle insurance fraud encompasses deliberate acts to file false or inflated claims. This project specifically targets the detection of such illicit activities through data-driven predictive analytics.

Stock Price Forecasting (ITX.MC)

Objective: To forecast the stock prices of Industria de Diseño Textil, S.A. (ITX.MC) by implementing and comparing various time series forecasting techniques. This project provides insights into predictive optimization analytics for financial markets.
